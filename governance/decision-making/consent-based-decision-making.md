# Consent-Based Decision-Making Process

At The Compassion Collective (TCC), we believe in empowering individuals and fostering collaboration through a consent-based approach to decision-making. This process ensures that every voice is heard and that decisions align with our shared values of inclusion, transparency, and empowerment.

## Key Principles
1. **Inclusivity:** All members are encouraged to participate in decision-making.
2. **Transparency:** The process is open and accessible to everyone in the collective.
3. **Empowerment:** Decisions are made collaboratively, ensuring no one person has undue influence.

## The Process

1. **Present the Proposal**
   - Any member can bring forward a proposal by sharing it in the **designated Discord channel** or during a community meeting.
   - The proposal should include:
     - The purpose or goal.
     - The steps or actions required.
     - Any anticipated impacts or consequences.

2. **Clarify and Discuss**
   - Members review the proposal and ask clarifying questions.
   - The proposer provides additional details or makes adjustments based on feedback.

3. **Open the Consent Window**
   - The proposal must remain open for feedback and discussion in the **Discord server** for at least **five (5) days.**
   - This ensures all members have ample time to engage with the proposal.

4. **Seek Five Consents**
   - For the proposal to pass, it must receive a minimum of **five (5) official consents** from community members. Responses can include:
     - **Consent:** Agreement to move forward.
     - **Objection:** A concern that must be resolved before proceeding.
     - **Reservation:** Mild concerns but willingness to proceed.

5. **Address Objections**
   - The group collaborates to address any objections raised during the consent window.
   - Adjustments are made to the proposal as needed to achieve consensus.

6. **Finalize the Decision**
   - Once all objections are resolved and the proposal has received five consents, the decision is officially recorded and implemented.
