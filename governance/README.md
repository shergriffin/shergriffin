# Governance Documents

Welcome to the governance hub of The Compassion Collective (TCC). This folder serves as a cornerstone for how we foster belonging, empowerment, and inclusion through compassionate and transparent decision-making.

## Contents
This folder includes:
- **Shared Agreements:** The principles and values that guide our interactions and collaborations.
- **Decision-Making Processes:** Frameworks for consent-based and inclusive governance.
- **Codes of Conduct:** Guidelines for creating a safe and respectful community space.

## Why Governance Matters
Governance at TCC is more than rulesâ€”it's a living framework that nurtures collaboration and ensures every voice is heard. By openly sharing these documents, we aim to inspire and support others in building equitable systems of their own.

## How to Use These Documents
- **Learn:** Explore how TCC operates and adapts to the needs of our community.

- **Contribute:** Suggest improvements or share your insights to help refine our processes.
