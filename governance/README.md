# Governance Documents

Welcome to the Governance section of The Compassion Collective (TCC). This folder contains foundational documents that guide how we collaborate, make decisions, and uphold our shared mission and values.

## This folder includes:
- [**Mission and Values**](./mission-and-values.md): The guiding principles that inspire and shape TCC’s work.
- [**Shared Agreements**](./shared-agreements.md): The principles and values that guide our interactions and collaborations.
- [**Decision-Making Processes**](./decision-making/consent-based-decision-making.md): Frameworks for consent-based and inclusive governance.

## Why Governance Matters
Governance is the backbone of The Compassion Collective. It ensures our practices are transparent, equitable, and aligned with our mission of fostering belonging and compassion.

By openly sharing these documents, we invite others to learn from and build upon our work, helping to create compassionate systems and communities everywhere.

## How to Use These Documents
- **Learn:** Understand the foundations of TCC’s collaborative culture.
- **Adopt:** Use our frameworks as inspiration for your own community or project.
- **Contribute:** Share feedback and ideas to refine and evolve these practices.
